1. Dockerization
Dockerfile Creation
Create a Dockerfile in the root of the Wisecow application repository. Hereâ€™s an example template based on a typical Node.js application:

dockerfile
Copy code
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the application's port
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
2. Kubernetes Deployment
Kubernetes Manifest Files
Create a k8s directory and include the following manifest files:

Deployment Manifest (wisecow-deployment.yaml)

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wisecow-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wisecow
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wisecow
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wisecow
        image: <your-docker-image>:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
Service Manifest (wisecow-service.yaml)

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wisecow-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 3000
  selector:
    app: wisecow
3. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
GitHub Actions Workflow
Create a .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml file for your GitHub Actions workflow:

yaml
Copy code
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

      - name: Login to Docker Registry
        uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

      - name: Build and Push Docker Image
        run: |
          docker build -t <your-docker-image>:latest .
          docker push <your-docker-image>:latest

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
        uses: azure/setup-kubectl@v1
        with:
          version: 'latest'

      - name: Update Kubernetes deployment
        run: |
          kubectl set image deployment/wisecow-deployment wisecow=<your-docker-image>:latest
4. TLS Implementation
Secure TLS Communication
You can use a Kubernetes Ingress controller with TLS support. For example, if using NGINX:

Create a TLS secret with your certificate:
bash
Copy code
kubectl create secret tls wisecow-tls --cert=path/to/tls.crt --key=path/to/tls.key
Create an Ingress resource (wisecow-ingress.yaml):
yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: wisecow-ingress
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - <your-domain>
    secretName: wisecow-tls
  rules:
  - host: <your-domain>
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: wisecow-service
            port:
              number: 80
5. Expected Artifacts
Ensure that your private GitHub repository includes:

The Wisecow application source code.
The Dockerfile.
Kubernetes manifest files (wisecow-deployment.yaml, wisecow-service.yaml, wisecow-ingress.yaml).
The GitHub Actions workflow file.
Access Control
Set your GitHub repository to public to fulfill the access control requirement.

End Goal
You should now have a fully containerized and deployed Wisecow application on Kubernetes, complete with an automated CI/CD pipeline and secured with TLS communication.
